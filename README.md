# ICVS-Summer-School
All the code needed for the ICVS Summer School 2023!

Here you will find everything you need to get started with your projects and outreach activity for the ICVS summer school.

There are three folders in this repo.

1) Arduino-Leonardo - this contains the documentation and code you need to get started with your projects that use the Arduino-Leonardo device.
2) Calibration-Instructions - this contains documents and code that walk you through the basics of measuring light, colour space conversions, gamma correction, and camera calibration.
3) Light-Bulb-Controlling - this contains information and code that will allow you to control the colour changing LED light bulbs we have available in the lab that you might wish to use for your outreach activity.

Note: this is the first time we've tried to run these Arduino projects and the hands on calibration demos using this worksheet. So please bare with us if hardware/software needs debugging - but that's the nature of science!
